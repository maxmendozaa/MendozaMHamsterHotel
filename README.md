Recreating a Hamster Hotel Website
Peer Review: Zahid Afsar
Peer Comment: The website does look similar to the orginal but the packages section does have a center-align on the prototype. Also the webiste is not responive to tablet or mobile and one way you could do this is by @media screen and (max-width 800px) and smaller for the mobile version Overall the desktop version is great you just need to make it responsive for the smaller screens.
